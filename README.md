# 4k-csharp
My reimplementation of [4koneko](https://github.com/koneko/4koneko) in C#. This is a work in progress so far, ideally I would also show this off.  
However this is my first time working with C# and I'm not sure of the best practices, so I'm eyeballing it.  
Of course, made in MonoGame.

## Building
So far only Windows, though I did pick the crossplatform template, so if you figure it out, let me know.  
You need to have [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) installed.  
Then, open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.  
If you want to build it from the command line, you can use `dotnet build` in the project directory.

## Running
You can run it from Visual Studio, or you can run the .exe file in the bin/Debug/net5.0-windows folder.

## Contributing
I'm not sure if I want to accept contributions yet, but if you want to, you can open an issue or a pull request.
